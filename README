DESCRIPTION
       This module queries the CPAN Testers website (via the AJAX interface)
       and retrieves a simple data set of results. It then parses these to
       answer a few simple questions.

INTERFACE
   The Constructor
       ·   new

           Instatiates the object CPAN::WWW::Testers. Requires a hash of
           parameters, with 'config' being the only mandatory key. Note that
           'config' can be anything that Config::IniFiles accepts for the
           -file option.

   Counter Methods
       ·   all

           For the given query, the total number of reports stored.

       ·   pass

           For the given query, the total number of PASS reports stored.

       ·   fail

           For the given query, the total number of FAIL reports stored.

       ·   na

           For the given query, the total number of NA reports stored.

       ·   unknown

           For the given query, the total number of UNKNOWN reports stored.

       ·   pc_pass

           For the given query, the percentage number of PASS reports stored
           against all reports stored.

       ·   pc_fail

           For the given query, the percentage number of FAIL reports stored
           against all reports stored.

       ·   pc_na

           For the given query, the percentage number of NA reports stored
           against all reports stored.

       ·   pc_unknown

           For the given query, the percentage number of UNKNOWN reports
           stored against all reports stored.

   Data Methods
       ·   data

           Returns the basic data structure as a hash reference. If a version
           is passed as a parameter, the data only for that version is
           returned. Otherwise all the results are returned, with the version
           as the top level key of the hash.

       ·   raw

           Returns the raw content returned from the server.
